Motion Planning Library for Grid Maps 

This library aims to provide pathfinding algorithms for grid based maps which are thoroughly unit tested and benchmarked for use in Robot Path Planning and Game development.

Currently the library provides the following path planning algorithms to the users:
1. Breadth First Search (2D)
2. Depth First Search (2D)
3. A-Star Heuristic Search (2D)
4. Jump Point Search (2D)

The following features are under development and will be added in the future:
1. Faster and Flexible versions of A-star 
2. Sampling Based Algorithms for Larger Search Spaces
3. Support for 3 Dimensional Planning
